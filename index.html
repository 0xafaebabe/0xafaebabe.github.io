Everyone in an organization impacts and has ownership of customer and user experiences. I mentor and guide people to understand the concepts of design thinking and user-centered design in order to create meaningful, positive impact in the world.</p><h2>Experience design and product management</h2><p>In my 26 years of experience (over 12 as a designer and 14 as a developer), I’ve worked in a variety of roles (developer, designer, researcher, product manager) for a diverse group of startups, agencies, and product companies. I focus on user experience design and leadership, because I love engaging directly with users and customers. My specialties include product development, design team management, and user-centered design. I craft and evolve products and services to make a positive impact on people’s daily lives, from work to play.</p><div class="text-center"><a href="https://assets.kyliejack.com/kyliejack/documents/kylie%20jack%20resume.pdf" target="_blank"><button>Download Resume</button></a></div></article><div class="col-span-3"></div></div></section><div class="break-lg"></div><section id="portfolio"><div class="container grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-12 gap-4"><header class="md:col-span-12"><h1>Portfolio</h1></header></div><div class="bg-secondary"><div class="container grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-12 gap-8"><div></div><article class="max-w-2xl sm:col-span-5 text-right"><h6>Product Design</h6><h2>Designing an enterprise tech support tool</h2><p>Leveraging prior research, I created scenarios, flows and an interactive prototype to inform development of a new enterprise technical support tool for a large computer manufacturer’s customer support staff.</p><a href="/ux-portfolio/enterprise-tech-support-tool"><button>Read More</button></a></article><div class="sm:col-span-5 grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4"><div class="sm:col-span-1"><img src="/images/previews/enterprise1.png" alt="A workflow diagram composed of labeled multi-color blobs"></div><div class="sm:col-span-1"><img src="/images/previews/enterprise2.png" alt="A wireframe of page showing a network diagram for computers being diagnosed"></div><div class="sm:col-span-2"><img src="/images/previews/enterprise3.png" alt="A finished high fidelity design of a network monitoring tool"></div></div><div></div></div></div><div class="break-xl"></div><div class="bg-secondary"><div class="container grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-12 gap-8"><div></div><div class="sm:col-span-5 grid sm:grid-cols-12 gap-4"><div class="sm:col-span-7"><img src="/images/previews/lighting1.png"></div><div class="sm:col-span-5 grid gap-4"><img src="/images/previews/lighting2.jpg"> <img src="/images/previews/lighting3.png"> <img src="/images/previews/lighting4.jpg"></div></div><article class="max-w-2xl sm:col-span-5 text-left"><h6>Interaction Design</h6><h2>Prototyping a lighting control app</h2><p>Configuring commercial lighting controllers during an installation is a difficult, time-consuming process.
