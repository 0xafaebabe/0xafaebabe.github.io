Our team had 12 weeks to design and validate 4" and 7" versions of interface.</p><p>Rather than a conference light switch with four buttons and presets, they wanted to emulate a smart home interface that was both simple but highly configurable. It had to work for users with little knowledge of complex lighting setups.</p><p>Additionally, the installation configuration software required a laptop and specialized software. They wanted newly installed systems to be able to be configured directly via the wall-switch screen.</p><h6>My role</h6><p>I was the sole interaction designer, assisted by a project manager, visual designer, and user researcher.</p><h6>What we did</h6><p>We held a three day requirements gathering session informed by an heuristic evaluation. I enumerated the requirements as user stories which informed a site map. I designed and prototyped an application which we tested with end users. We explored visual designs and tested user preferences.</p></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/visual-3.png"><p>The final UI using my IA/IX, and painted by a visual designer.</p><p></p></div><div></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/orig-1.jpg"><p>LeGrand's original smart lighting interface.</p></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/orig-2.png"><p>The original configuration tool interface.</p></div><div></div><header class="md:col-span-6"><h1>Research</h1></header><div class="md:col-span-4 grid grid-cols-2 gap-4"><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/research-2.jpg"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/research-3.png"></div><div></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/research-1.png"></div></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><h6></h6><p>I started by using Neilsen Norman Group's basic categories for Heuristic Evaluations and applying them to the existing interface.</p><p>The client already had a rich set of quantitative research to work from. I conducted stakeholder interviews to talk through user goals and understand their needs. Many users would have to use the interface with no previous knowledge. Intuitiveness was critical.</p><p>We then collaborated at the whiteboard to define work flows for different person types such as basic user, a building manager, and installer.</p></div><header class="md:col-span-6"><h1>Definition</h1></header><div class="md:col-span-2"><h6></h6><p>After creating a service blueprint to combine user goals and personas in a complete picture, I continued to explore the problem space by articulating a high level site map connecting the different screens necessary to support the flow.</p></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/definition-1.png"></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/definition-2.png"></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><h6></h6><p>I often find the easy way to start indexing my design tasks is to decompose flows into a set of specific user stories. I sized and prioritized the users stories, and iterated with the client to make sure we were in alignment.</p></div><div class="md:col-span-3"><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/definition-3.png"></div><div></div><div></div><header class="md:col-span-4"><h1>Design</h1></header><div></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-4"><p>I quickly created generalized wireframes to get an understanding of the information architecture and to itemize the content needed on each screen. I did this for both of their hardware models, one of which was a vertical 4" screen, and a landscape 7" screen. I used Axure RP to build animations for transitions that would help the user understand the flow of the interface.</p></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-3"><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-a-1.png"></div><div class="md:col-span-3"><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-a-2.png"></div><div class="break-lg md:col-span-6"></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-4"><h6></h6><p>Once I showed the client the information architecture proposals, I dove deeper into the microinteractions of the interface. I used the principles of progressive disclosure to reveal more complex interface elements after presenting the user with the simplest interface possible.</p></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-2"></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-a-4.gif"></div><div class="md:col-span-2"></div><div class="break-lg md:col-span-6"></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-4"><h6></h6><p>I continued to dive deeper into each screen interface, generating high-fidelity wireframes. Axure allowed me to model highly complex interactions which would be critical for our usability tests.</p></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-6 grid grid-cols-3 gap-4"><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-1.png"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-2.png"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-3.png"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-4.png"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-5.png"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-6.png"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-7.png"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-8.png"></div><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-b-9.png"></div></div><div class="break-lg md:col-span-6"></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-4"><h6></h6><p>One of the most difficult challenges was porting the existing Windows configuration software into the 4" interface. The client was only expecting to be able to configure via the 7" screen, but I knew it was doable on the smaller size as well.</p></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-2"></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><div><img src="/images/galleries/lighting/design-c-1.png"></div></div><div class="md:col-span-2"></div><div></div><header class="md:col-span-4"><h1>Prototyping</h1></header><div></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-4"><h6></h6><p>This movie shows the comprehensive level of interactions I was able to achieve in Axure. When I run usability tests, it's not enough to test a hero-path. I wanted users to be able to freely explore the entire system.</p></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-2"></div><div class="md:col-span-2"><video width="452px" height="599px" controls="true" loop="true" autoplay="true" muted="true"><source src="https://assets.kyliejack.com/kyliejack/video/commercial-lighting/prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Browser does not support HTML5 video.</p></video></div><div class="md:col-span-2"></div><div></div><header class="md:col-span-4"><h1>Usability Testing</h1></header><div></div><div></div><header class="md:col-span-4"><h1>Visual Design</h1></header><div></div><div></div><header class="md:col-span-4"><h1>Results</h1></header><div></div><div></div><div class="md:col-span-4 grid grid-cols-6 gap-4"><div class="quotemark col-span-1">&ldquo;</div><div class="quotation col-span-5"><p>We're very happy with the work that you did.
